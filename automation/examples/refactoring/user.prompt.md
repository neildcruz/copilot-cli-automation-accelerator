# Code Refactoring User Prompt

Analyze the codebase and perform refactoring:

1. Identify code smells and technical debt
2. Extract reusable functions and modules
3. Simplify complex conditional logic
4. Improve error handling patterns
5. Standardize naming conventions
6. Break down large functions/classes
7. Remove dead code and unused dependencies
8. Apply appropriate design patterns

For each refactoring, explain the rationale and ensure tests still pass.
